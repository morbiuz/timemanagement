== TIME MANAGEMENT

This application aims to help freelancers to keep track of the time they spend on each project. It was developed as a way for me to put in practice everything I learned with the edX "Software as a Service" course. 

Although it is not entirely polished, you can try it out in http://time-management-app.herokuapp.com/

This project teached me how to:

* Build a Ruby on Rails project from scratch.

* Use Single Sign-On with Twitter and Facebook accounts

* Show graphs using {Chartkick}[https://github.com/ankane/chartkick]

* CSS layout with Flexbox
